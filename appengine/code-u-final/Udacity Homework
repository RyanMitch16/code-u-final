Udacity Homework

I feel that the Udacity course was helpful, but was not easy to lean from. Sunshine had us go through videos that taught us how to develop  quality Android apps. The only problem was that, they frequently asked us to implement various parts of the apps by reading through documentation and figuring out for ouselves. It seemed it was more helpful in teaching us the ideas behind Android development and classes to use rather than teaching us how to program them. After you implemented it yourself, you could then see their solution. At first I iplemented everything myself and then checked their solution, but once we got to content providers, I was clueless and had to copy their code. I found it easier to learn though from looking at their code rather than implementing it myslef. The Udacity course gave us a good general knowledge of what to be aware of while programming our apps. Having to develop our own though really helped me understand everything. Now I have full confidence in my ability to make Android apps after completeing our final project.
